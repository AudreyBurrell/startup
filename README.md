# Doodle Drop

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application will allow the user to draw something, save it to a "gallery", and share it with others.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Key features

- Login
- Save to gallery
- View gallery
- Share with others
- The color options and clear on the canvas

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I would use HTML to create the drawing canvas and the various buttons. There will be four HTML pages. One for the login, another for the canvas, and the other two for the gallery and sharing with another person.
- **CSS** - I would use CSS to allow the user to change colors and to clear the canvas. I would also use it to make the website pretty :). 
- **React** - I would use this for login, sharing, and displaying previous images in the gallery
- **Service** - Login and sharing drawings.
- **DB/Login** - Stores user login information and securely storing them.
- **WebSocket** - Sharing the images/drawings with others.
